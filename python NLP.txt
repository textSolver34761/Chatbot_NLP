Tokenizing - word and sentence. Seperates by words or sentence.
Lexicon and corporas
corporas is body of text like medical journal,
lexicon is a dico - words and means

investor-speak vs regular english-speak

investor-speak : bull --> someone who's positive about the stock market;
english-speak : bull --> animal

You would separate words by using space or saying when ponctuation and space and capial letter, then, it's a new sentance.
But, If we have "Hi Mr. Smith ...", we have ponctuation, space and Capital letter. And it's not a new sentance

Using word_tokenize or sent_tokenize will save that work for you!!

Stop words:

analyse part text
and help with stop words

words starcasticly or without meaning (a, the, and) filler words
USELESS for analisys USEFULL for humains.

example_sentence = "This is an example showing off stop word filtration."
Machine ketp : ['This', 'example', 'showing', 'stop', 'word', 'filtration', '.']
