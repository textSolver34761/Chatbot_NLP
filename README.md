# Chatbot_NLP

As I am aware of the GRCPD law, I want to change the chatbot I've build for my laravel_porfolio, because I don't know were datas are going: I made the chatbot with the landbot.io company.<br>
When this chatbot is going to be created, I'll merge it with the PHP (laravel_porfolio) project.
